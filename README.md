# wintop

A `top` clone for Windows systems.

In other words, a command-line tool for Windows to monitor running processes and system performance in real-time.

This project is built in `C#` (`.NET`) and uses design patterns extensively.

*Why*, you may ask? Because I developed this tool in order to apply what I was learning in my Design Patterns course at the Lebanese University.
